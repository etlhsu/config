### Structure
I generall use top-level folders organized by general category. Then I introduce the following kinds of subfolders:
* `tub/` - for everything else, structured
  * `pile/` - for everything else, unstructured
* `space/` - a temporary environment for trying things out
* `*/` - keep important projects at their own folders
